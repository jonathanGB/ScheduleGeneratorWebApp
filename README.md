# uOttawa Calendar Generator

### Automatically grabs your uOttawa schedule of your current and/or following semesters and populates your google calendar with your courses. Plus, lets you choose specific colours for lectures, DGDs/tutorials and Labs!

#### Works on all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux)!

### Steps
1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - at least v4.4.4
  * This runs the CLI app, does the scraping and multiple requests to APIs
2.  Use `git` to download the repository or download it as a zip file and decompress it. **Don't move the files relative to each other!**
3. When that's done, open your `cmd` or `terminal` and go to the root of the project. E.g. if you installed it at `C:/Downloads/Project`, that is the root of the project.
  * See [this](http://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands) if you don't know how to change directories in the command-line
4. Run `npm install` - this installs all the dependencies of the project.
5. Run `node run` - this starts the app. Follow the steps, and your calendar should now be generated automatically :)
